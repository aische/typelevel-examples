# Haskell Type Level Example Programs

Open ghci and load the one of the examples:


	stack ghci
	
	ghci> :l src/TypeLevelFibonacci.hs


All programs are written as Types. Given a program called "Example1", it can be run by typing

    ghci> :kind! Example1
    
In most cases, for a program called "Example1" there is also a value called "example1" with type "Proxy Example1". It can be run by typing

	ghci> :t example1

For some examples you might have to increase the reduction depth:

	ghci> :set -freduction-depth=10000
or

	ghci> :set -freduction-depth=0
		
Some examples will not show the fully evaluated result type by using ":kind!". In these cases a value is defined that uses the result type in its type signature to check if the result type is what we expect.
	
## Fibonacci

Compute fibonacci numbers

	type family Fibonacci n where
	  Fibonacci n = Fibonacci' n 0 1

	type family Fibonacci' n i j where
	  Fibonacci' 0 i j = '[]
	  Fibonacci' n i j = i ': Fibonacci' (n-1) j (i+j)

	type Example1 = Fibonacci 10

	example1 :: Proxy Example1
	example1 = Proxy

Typing ":kind! Example1" will result in

	Example1 :: [Nat] = '[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

Typing ":t example1" will result in

## SKI Combinators

The Example1 program adds two numbers, 2 and 3. Unfortunately the command ":kind! Example1" won't show the fully evaluated result. To check if the resulting type is what we expect, we define the value "example1". We give "Maybe" as successor function and "Int" as zero, and give "example1" the type "Run Example1" and a value of (Just (Just (Just (Just (Just Int))))). If the resulting type did not match, the type checker would complain.

## Lambda Calculus

This is a limited version of a lambda calculus interpreter, it does not perform alpha conversion.

Note: This is not a type level lambda, because the resulting types must have kind "*". 

Like with the SKI Combinators example, we will not see the result by using ":kind! Example1". We expect that the Example1 will evaluate to "Int" and check it by defining "example1".

                    (Var "x"))))))))

Example3 will evaluate to

	Maybe (Maybe (Maybe (Maybe (Maybe Int))))

## Parser

This is a very simple parser combinator.

    data Ok s a
    data Fail
    data Item
    data Return a
    data Then p f
    data Then_ p1 p2
    data Or p1 p2
    data Elem cs
    data Some p
    data ReturnF
    data ConsF p
    data Cons1F x
    data Cons x xs
    data Nil

    type family Parse p s where
      Parse p s = CheckResult (RunP p s)

    type family CheckResult r where
      CheckResult (Ok '[] x) = (Ok '[] x)
      CheckResult x = Fail

    type family RunP p s where
      RunP Item (x ': xs)   = Ok xs x
      RunP Item '[]         = Fail
      RunP (Return a) xs    = Ok xs a
      RunP (Then p f) xs    = RunThen (RunP p xs) f
      RunP (Then_ p1 p2) xs = RunThen_ (RunP p1 xs) p2
      RunP (Or p1 p2) xs    = RunOr (RunP p1 xs) p2 xs
      RunP (Elem c)   xs    = RunElem c xs
      RunP (Some p)   xs    = RunP (Or (Then p (ConsF (Some p))) (Return Nil)) xs

    type family RunElem cs ss where
      RunElem (c ': xs) (c ': ss) = Ok ss c
      RunElem (c ': xs) ss        = RunElem xs ss
      RunElem cs        ss        = Fail

    type family RunThen r f where
      RunThen Fail      f          = Fail
      RunThen (Ok xs x) ReturnF    = (Ok xs x)
      RunThen (Ok xs x) (ConsF p)  = RunThen (RunP p xs) (Cons1F x)
      RunThen (Ok xs x) (Cons1F a) = (Ok xs (Cons a x))

    type family RunThen_ r f where
      RunThen_ Fail      p = Fail
      RunThen_ (Ok xs x) p = RunP p xs

    type family RunOr r p xs where
      RunOr (Ok xs x) p ys = Ok xs x
      RunOr Fail p xs      = RunP p xs

    type Many p = Then p (ConsF (Some p))

    type IsDigit = Elem ["1", "2", "3"]
    type IsAlpha = Elem ["a", "b", "c"]
    type Digits = Many IsDigit
    type Alphas = Many IsAlpha

    type Parser1 = Then Alphas (ConsF (Then Digits (ConsF (Return Nil))))

    type Inp1 = '["1", "3"]
    type Inp2 = '["a", "2", "1"]

    type Example1 = Parse Parser1 Inp1 -- fail
    type Example2 = Parse Parser1 Inp2 -- ok

Parser1 expects some alphas and the some digits. Example1 will apply it to an input without the alphas and will fail. Example2 will succeed.

Typing ":kind! Example1" will result in 

	Example1 :: * = Fail

Typing ":kind! Example2" will result in 

	Example2 :: * = Ok '[] (Cons (Cons "a" Nil) (Cons (Cons "2" (Cons "1" Nil)) Nil))
